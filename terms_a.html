<p><b>Application</b>: Charles Dickens' character Ebenezer Scrooge is one of the most iconic literary curmudgeons, embodying not only grumpiness but also resistance to empathy and social generosity.

<p><b>Application</b>: In political discourse, dysphemism is frequently employed to discredit opponents or delegitimize opposing viewpoints. During contentious debates over immigration policy, one may resort to dysphemistic language to characterize immigrants or their supporters, using terms such as "invaders" or "illegals" to evoke fear, resentment, and hostility towards marginalized communities.</p></span></span></span></div>

<p><b>Application</b>: In Greek mythology, many heroes are brought down by hubris, their excessive pride pushing them to defy the gods.</p>
<p><b>Application</b>: Napoleon Bonaparte's campaign to conquer Europe was marked by extraordinary successes, but his overreach ultimately led to his downfall. His attempt to invade Russia in 1812, despite warnings and the immense logistical challenges, resulted in a devastating defeat.

<span class='definition'><i>v.</i> (jury-rigged, <i>adj.</i>) constructed or repaired hastily, crudely, or using makeshift methods, often with materials at hand, resulting in a functional but less than optimal solution; implies a lack of proper planning, expertise, or resources, leading to a makeshift or temporary solution that may be prone to failure or inefficiency.

<p><b>Application</b>: The Wright brothers' first airplane was built with limited resources and materials on hand, making use of bicycle parts and other improvised components. While not a perfect machine by today's standards, their jury-rigged airplane achieved powered flight in 1903, revolutionizing transportation.</p>
<p><b>Application</b>: During the ill-fated Apollo 13 mission in 1970, a damaged oxygen tank jeopardized the crew's survival. NASA engineers, alongside the astronauts, famously "jury-rigged" a carbon dioxide filter using materials on board, including plastic bags and tape. This quick, creative solution kept the crew alive until they returned safely to Earth.</p>
<p><b>Application</b>: In many developing areas, people construct homes or barriers using readily available materials like scrap wood, sheet metal, or plastic. This "jury-rigged" housing highlights ingenuity and resilience, even though these structures lack the stability and durability of permanent homes.</p></span></span></span></div>

<span class='term'>paunch</span>,
<span class='definition'><i>n.</i> an anatomical feature of mammals, particularly in the context of human anatomy, denoting a protrusion of the lower abdomen or belly, often characterized by excess adipose tissue or visceral fat; used colloquially to describe a prominent or protruding belly, often associated with obesity or a sedentary lifestyle. 
<span class='see-more'>(See more.)<span class='tooltip'>
<p><b>Application</b>: In portraits of prominent Renaissance figures, a slight paunch was sometimes seen as a symbol of affluence and prosperity. Artists would often depict wealthy patrons or monarchs with rounded, fuller stomachs to emphasize their access to abundant resources. For instance, in Titian's portraits of Emperor Charles V, his slight paunch underscores both the power and physical presence of the ruler, symbolizing both his age and standing.</p>
<p><b>Application</b>: Victorian literature often referenced a character's paunch to convey deeper personality traits. In Charles Dickens' <i>The Pickwick Papers</i>, Mr. Pickwick is depicted with a noticeable paunch, using it as a visual marker for his kind-hearted yet sometimes bumbling nature. The paunch here becomes shorthand for his geniality, humor, and somewhat leisurely disposition, linking physical form to character.</p>
<p><b>Application</b>: In contrast, medieval Christian texts sometimes regarded a paunch as a sign of moral laxity or a lack of discipline, as in descriptions of monks or friars who struggled with gluttony, a cardinal sin. Chaucer's <i>Canterbury Tales</i> includes the “Monk” and the “Friar,” each depicted as men who do not adhere strictly to religious asceticism, with fuller figures hinting at indulgence in worldly pleasures.</p></span></span></span></div>

<p><b>Etymology</b>: Originating in 1980s American slang, the term "poindexter" is believed to derive from a character named Poindexter in the American animated television series <i>Felix the Cat</i>. Poindexter, portrayed as a bespectacled, academically inclined young boy with a penchant for science, symbolized a caricature of the archetypal "nerd" or "bookworm." Over time, the name came to be applied more broadly to individuals perceived as highly intellectual but socially awkward or lacking conventional charisma.</p>
<p><b>Application</b>: The character of Charles Babbage, 19th-century mathematician and inventor of the mechanical computer, might be viewed as a "poindexter" figure: brilliant yet noted for his eccentric, solitary devotion to analytical engines and perceived aloofness from popular society.</p></span></span></span></div>
